# Robo Angle Seeker

## Overview
This repository accompanies the research paper "Precision Angle Seeking in Robots: A Reinforcement Learning Approach in Simulation and Reality." Our study investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms for precision angle seeking in robotic control, highlighting the transition from simulations to real-world applications. The "Angular Positioning Seeker (APS)" environment, built on stm32f103 and Raspberry Pi 4B+ platforms, serves as a novel benchmark for assessing RL algorithms under conditions that closely emulate real-world scenarios.

## Features
- Advanced RL and DRL algorithms for precision control of robotic angles.
- The APS environment, a custom simulation tailored for angle seeking rather than balance.
- Integration with Raspberry Pi and STM32F103ZET6 microcontroller for real-world application.
- Comprehensive experimental setups for both simulated and physical environments detailed in the paper.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch (for specific algorithm implementations)
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4B+, STM32F103ZET6 microcontroller, L298N motor driver, DC3V-6V geared DC motors (TT motors), and additional components as listed in the paper's appendix.
